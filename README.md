TEXT EXTRACTION FROM VIDEO CLIP
 
ABSTRACT:
Todayâ€™s rapidly digitizing world is a world that is redefining the very concept of interaction. One of the major steps being taken is in the ever-dynamic, ever-expanding world of education. As a result, there is an increased demand for video tutorials for study purpose, online courses and tutorials for entrance exams, as most of the videos are proved to be effective, uploaded by experts in domain and is a very effective audio video learning resource,but sometimes the videos are too long and time-consuming and explained way too briefly for an average user.With the help of advanced NLP, audio is extracted from the video tutorial which is then converted to text format. We can now extract  the text from video tutorial and store in text file which would contain the all the  points of the video tutorial.In this project we can mainly convert English language videos into text .In the core of this system NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), which is a python library for working on Natural Language Processing.
 
DATASET REQUIRED: This project requires previously downloaded video clip to convert into audio in order to generate the text file.
PROPOSED SYSTEM :We can easily understand the content when it is explained in simpler words and shorter time.
We can read the entire transcript of any video which is given as input.
Unlike subtitles which are automatically generated for the video it provides a simplified version of the total context.
